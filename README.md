# Library Management System
Description:
The Library Management System is a console-based application designed to efficiently manage a library's book inventory and lending operations. This Java project provides librarians and administrators with a user-friendly interface to add, search, update, and remove books from the library. It also allows users to borrow and return books, check book availability, and view library statistics.

Features:
- Add new books to the library with title and author details.
- Display the complete list of books in the library.
- Search for books by title or author.
- Remove unwanted books from the library.
- Update book details, including title and author information.
- Borrow books from the library, and track borrowers' names.
- Return borrowed books and update their availability status.
- Check the availability status of a book, along with the borrower's name (if borrowed).
- View statistics on the total number of books, available books, and borrowed books.

Drawbacks:
- Console-based interface lacks visual appeal and may not be suitable for all users.
- The system supports only single-user access at a time.
- Data is stored in memory, leading to data loss when the program terminates.
- The system does not consider book categories or genres for organization.
- Error handling is limited, which may result in unexpected behavior.

Future Scope:
- Implement user authentication for secure access to administrative features.
- Develop a book reservation system to allow users to reserve books on loan.
- Integrate a fine management system to track and notify users of overdue fines.
- Add reporting and analytics functionalities for library usage insights.
- Create a mobile application version for on-the-go library management.
- Integrate barcode or RFID technology for automated book handling.
- Ensure accessibility compliance for users with disabilities.
- Support internationalization and localization for multi-language support.
- Migrate to a cloud-based infrastructure for scalability and reliability.
